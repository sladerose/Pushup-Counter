# Pushup-Counter

This project provides a simple pushup counter application.

## Functionality

- Counts pushups using a video input (`pushup.mp4`).
- Logs pushup counts to a text file (`pushup_counter_log.txt`).
- Can be run via a batch script (`run_pushup_counter.bat`) on Windows.

## Files

- `main.py`: The core Python script for the pushup counter logic.
- `pushup.mp4`: Example video file used for pushup detection.
- `pushup_counter_log.txt`: A log file to record pushup counts.
- `run_pushup_counter.bat`: A batch script to easily run the application on Windows.
